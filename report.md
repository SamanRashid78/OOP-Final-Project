Executive Summary 
Overview: 
The Learning Management System (LMS) project aims to create a C++-based 
application that supports remote education by enhancing accessibility, interactivity, 
and personalized learning. The project was designed with dual interfaces tailored 
to both students and teachers, offering features such as lecture uploads, online 
quizzes, and user-friendly navigation. 
Key Findings: 
 Developed a fully functional C++ LMS application with dual interfaces. 
 Ensured accessibility through native language content creation. 
 Successfully integrated online assessments. 
 Aligned the system with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to 
education, innovation, and reduced inequalities. 
Introduction 
Background: 
E-learning platforms are transforming traditional education by offering flexible, 
inclusive, and interactive learning environments. This project aligns with OOP 
principles by implementing core object-oriented concepts like encapsulation, 
inheritance, and polymorphism in a real-world application. 
Project Objectives: 
 Design a user-friendly LMS using C++ with clear segregation between 
student and educator roles. 
 Provide functionality for educational content delivery through 
announcements. 
 Implement assessment features via online quizzes with score tracking. 
 Promote SDG goals through digital inclusion and innovation in learning. 
 Enable secure registration and login with password masking. 
 Facilitate user progress tracking through quiz score records 
Project Description 
Scope: 
Included Features: 
 Dual interface for teachers and students 
 Secure user registration with password masking 
 Course-based announcements 
 Online quiz creation 
 Online quiz taking 
 User activity tracking 
Excluded Features: 
 Real-time video conferencing 
 Mobile application version 
 Third-party integrations 
Technical Overview: 
 Programming Language: C++ 
 IDEs Used: Embarcadero Dev C++, Visual Studio 
 Resources: Static libraries, YouTube tutorials (MUMINJOON, Simplilearn) 
Methodology 
Approach: 
The project was carried out using a weekly task-planning model. Progress was 
tracked against a project timeline, focusing on modular development and early 
testing of core functionalities. 
Roles and Responsibilities: 
Saman (23K-6078): 
 Entire project development and design 
 User Interface development 
 Integration of quizzes 
 Handled integration of registration, login, and session management 
 Documentation, debugging and testing 
Project Implementation 
Design and Structure: 
The application was built with two main modules: 
 Educator Module: Enables educators to create quizzes and post 
announcements for courses. 
 Student Module: Allows students to view announcements, take quizzes, 
and check their scores. 
Functionalities Developed: 
 User registration and login system 
 Distinct dashboards for students and teachers 
 Online quiz system 
 Announcement system 
 User session management 
Challenges Faced: 
 UI Design in C++: Overcame limitations by focusing on command-line 
interface aesthetics. 
 Data handling: Implemented simple file storage and retrieval mechanisms 
for user data and content. 
 Limited library support: Relied on static libraries and online community 
support to implement key features. 
Results 
Project Outcomes: 
 Delivered a stable and usable LMS application using C++. 
 Successfully demonstrated the application of OOP principles in a practical 
scenario.
 Provided a scalable base for future enhancements such as database 
integration and GUI.

Testing and Validation: 
 Manual testing was conducted for all user flows. 
 Edge cases like invalid logins, empty inputs, and multiple users were 
handled. 
 Functional testing ensured each module performed its intended task. 
Conclusion 
Summary of Findings: 
This project demonstrates how a C++ application can be used to simulate an 
educational platform, supporting the shift from traditional to digital learning 
methods. It fulfills the core goals of providing accessible, interactive, and flexible 
learning environments. 
Final Remarks: 
The LMS developed has the potential to be expanded further with GUI integration, 
database support, and mobile compatibility. This experience enhanced practical 
understanding of OOP and showed how technology can bridge educational gaps 
across the globe.
